<h2> A Welcome from the Founding Director: Prof. Jinghong Fan </h2>

Welcome to the International Institute of Multiscale Materials Modeling (IIMMM) at Alfred University and thank you for visiting our website.
<p>
The IIMMM is a XXX-funded international institute, recently founded at Alfred University, NY, USA, in partnership with XX, XX, and XX. The intent of the Institute is to bring scholars and researchers together to push forward multiscale methodologies and their potential applications in material science and engineering. The logic is to combine various efforts to enhance innovation in this field.
<p>
This site provides a <a href="methods/review.html">review of multiscale methods</a> in the literature and gives descriptions of <a href="methods.html">individual multiscale methods</a>, where some groups have generously made their programs public.
<p>
We hope you enjoy your visit to the IIMMM. If there are any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to <a href="index.html#contact">contact us</a>.
<p>
Prof. Jinghong Fan<br>
