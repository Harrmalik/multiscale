<h3>Introduction</h3>
Most partitioned-domain methods treat the continuum domain such that lattice dislocations are either implemented via elastic constitutive relations, or not permitted at all. This motivated development of a new multiscale method called the concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) method that admits displacement discontinuities between elements in the continuum domain. Within each element, lattice defects are not allowed and the displacement field has C<sup>1</sup> continuity. Between elements, however, neither displacement continuity nor strain compatibility is required.
<p>
The theoretical foundation of the CAC method is the atomistic field theory (AFT). It is rooted in micromorphic theory, where a local density function is used to connect the micromorphic theory and molecular dynamics, in which a crystalline material is viewed as a continuous collection of lattice points, while embedded within each point is a unit cell with a group of discrete atoms (<a href="#chen1">Chen, 2009</a>). The same balance equations for both fully resolved atomistic and coarse-grained continuum domains are employed to compute the properties of general crystals. In the continuum domain, the interatomic potential serves as the only constitutive relation.
